#First, let's create a database profile for local testing.
spring:
  data:
   mongodb:
     uri: mongodb://user:password@ds159517.mlab.com:59517/example
 application:
   name: example

#Next, a profile for QA testing, as to not have Local testing be affected.
spring:
  profiles: qa
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: mongodb://user:password@ds159497.mlab.com:59497/example_qa
  application:
    name: example

---

#Finally, a profile for production, as to not have QA and Local testing affected
spring:
  profiles: prod
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: mongodb://user:password@ds159527.mlab.com:59527/example_prod
  application:
    name: example

#All database connections are legitimate connections setup for free via mlab.com. Normally, the "user:password" would
#be something secure, but as this is an example, I decided to keep it simple.
